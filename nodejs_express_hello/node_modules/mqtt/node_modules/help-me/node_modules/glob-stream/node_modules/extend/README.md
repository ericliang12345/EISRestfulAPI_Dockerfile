## extend\(\) for Node.js

`node-extend` is a port of the classic extend\(\) method from jQuery. It behaves as you expect. It is simple, tried and true.

### Installation

This package is available on [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/extend) as: `extend`

```bash
npm install extend
```

### Usage

**Syntax:** extend **\(** \[`deep`\], `target`, `object1`, \[`objectN`\] **\)**

_Extend one object with one or more others, returning the modified object._

Keep in mind that the target object will be modified, and will be returned from extend\(\).

If a boolean true is specified as the first argument, extend performs a deep copy, recursively copying any objects it finds. Otherwise, the copy will share structure with the original object\(s\). Undefined properties are not copied. However, properties inherited from the object's prototype will be copied over. Warning: passing `false` as the first argument is not supported.

#### Arguments

* `deep` _Boolean_ \(optional\)

  If set, the merge becomes recursive \(i.e. deep copy\).

* `target`    _Object_

  The object to extend.

* `object1`    _Object_

  The object that will be merged into the first.

* `objectN` _Object_ \(Optional\)

  More objects to merge into the first.
