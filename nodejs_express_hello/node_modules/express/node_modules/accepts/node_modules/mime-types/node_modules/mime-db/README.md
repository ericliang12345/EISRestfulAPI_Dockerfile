This is a database of all mime types. It consists of a single, public JSON file and does not include any logic, allowing it to remain as un-opinionated as possible with an API. It aggregates data from the following sources:

* [http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)
* [http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types)
* [http://hg.nginx.org/nginx/raw-file/default/conf/mime.types](http://hg.nginx.org/nginx/raw-file/default/conf/mime.types)

## Installation

```bash
npm install mime-db
```

### Database Download

If you're crazy enough to use this in the browser, you can just grab the JSON file using [RawGit](https://rawgit.com/). It is recommended to replace `master` with [a release tag](https://github.com/jshttp/mime-db/tags) as the JSON format may change in the future.

```text
https://cdn.rawgit.com/jshttp/mime-db/master/db.json
```

## Usage

```javascript
var db = require('mime-db');

// grab data on .js files
var data = db['application/javascript'];
```

## Data Structure

The JSON file is a map lookup for lowercased mime types. Each mime type has the following properties:

* `.source` - where the mime type is defined.

    If not set, it's probably a custom media type.

  * `apache` - [Apache common media types](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/trunk/docs/conf/mime.types)
  * `iana` - [IANA-defined media types](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)
  * `nginx` - [nginx media types](http://hg.nginx.org/nginx/raw-file/default/conf/mime.types)

* `.extensions[]` - known extensions associated with this mime type.
* `.compressible` - whether a file of this type can be gzipped.
* `.charset` - the default charset associated with this type, if any.

If unknown, every property could be `undefined`.

## Contributing

To edit the database, only make PRs against `src/custom.json` or `src/custom-suffix.json`.

To update the build, run `npm run build`.

## Adding Custom Media Types

The best way to get new media types included in this library is to register them with the IANA. The community registration procedure is outlined in [RFC 6838 section 5](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838#section-5). Types registered with the IANA are automatically pulled into this library.
